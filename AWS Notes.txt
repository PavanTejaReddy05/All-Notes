AWS:
===
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
1.CLOUD==>Instead of Buying the Physical Server to Deploy the Application we can use Virtualisation and can use virtual Server with IP Addresses and can work accordingly with lesser Costs.

2.PRIVATE CLOUD===>If Team A uses Cloud with their Instance and that Team A are not allowed to give the instance to Other organizations. 

3.PUBLIC CLOUD===>Anyone with AWS OR AZZURE Account Irrespective of any organization can create instances Ex:-Amazon, Microsoft, Google
->Can create a Virtual Private cloud in a Public Cloud

IAM:--
IAM Service is used to create IAM user or child User from Root user
IAM in AWS is a combination of Both Authentication & Authorization for child or IAM User
IAM helps to create & describe the user details, user permissions
(USERS + POLICIES + GROUPS) + Roles ==IAM
Users=User Details(Credentials , Info of User)
Policies= What are the actions can user do
groups= Category of user (Helps to Set the Policies in smart way in single step) by creating the category of people only can do particular actions
Roles = Giving Temporary Access to AWS Account with [Access Key + Secret Access key + Session Token]

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
EC2=Elastic Cloud Compute
Elastic= in AWS Many Services have prefix "Elastic" that can increase or decrease the service
Cloud= in AWS cloud
Compute= Req Instance(CPU + RAM + Disk)
So EC2=Give me a Virtual Server in AWS cloud which is in Elastic Nature
EC2 Instance:--(EC2 Creation, EC2 Instance Connection, To deploy application in EC2 Instance, How access the application from outside world)
