My name is B. Pavan Teja Reddy. I graduated from SRM University Chennai with a degree in Electronics and Computer Engineering, specializing in ECE, and completed my graduation with an 8.5 CGPA.

I have completed an internship at TATA Group focused on Data Visualization. Additionally, I have undertaken projects such as an Online Voting System using Blockchain and Vehicle-to-Vehicle Communication using Long Range technology.

For the past four months, I have been interning at a startup branch called AxiomIO, where I have been trained in DevOps. My training has included Docker containerization, APIs, and MongoDB. I am also proficient in executing Linux commands and using Git.

In my free time, I enjoy traveling and listening to music.
