What is blockchain technology?

Blockchain technology is a decentralized and distributed ledger system that records transactions across multiple computers in a way that ensures the security, transparency, and immutability of the data.


2.How does a blockchain work?
A blockchain works by maintaining a continuously growing list of records, called blocks, that are linked and secured using cryptographic techniques.

3.What is a block in a blockchain?
A block in a blockchain is a fundamental unit that contains a collection of data related to transactions and other information. Each block is linked to the previous one, forming a chain.


4.What is the difference between blockchain and cryptocurrency?
 while blockchain is the foundational technology that can be applied in many areas, cryptocurrency is a financial application of blockchain focused on creating and managing digital currencies.

5.What are the key features of blockchain technology?
Decentralization, Immutability, Transparency, Security

6.What is a decentralized ledger?
A decentralized ledger is a digital database that is replicated, shared, and synchronized across multiple participants (nodes) in a network. Unlike traditional centralized databases that are managed by a single entity, a decentralized ledger operates without a central authority, ensuring that no single participant has complete control over the data. 

7.What is a smart contract?
A smart contract is a self-executing contract with the terms of the agreement directly written into code.

8.What are the benefits of using blockchain technology?
Decentralization, Security, Traceability


9.What is a public vs. private blockchain?
 Public blockchains offer transparency, decentralization, and a trustless environment, while private blockchains provide control, privacy, and scalability, making them ideal for enterprise applications.



10.How are transactions verified in a blockchain network?
Transactions in a blockchain network are verified through a process that involves consensus among the network participants. 


What are some real-world applications of blockchain technology?
Charity, Cryptocurrency, Online Voting System

12.How does blockchain ensure security and privacy?
Distribution of Control:,
Each block in the blockchain contains a cryptographic hash of the previous block's data, creating a chain that is resistant to tampering. 


13.What is the role of miners in a blockchain network?
Transaction Validaters, Block Creations, and rewarded for their effort by solving hard puzzles


14.What is a blockchain fork?
 leading to the creation of a new chain and potentially new cryptocurrencies. 


15.What are tokens and how are they used in blockchain networks?
They can be used for purchasing goods and services or transferring value between users.


16.How can blockchain be integrated with IoT (Internet of Things)?
Users can control access to their IoT data through blockchain-based identity and access management systems.


17.What are zero-knowledge proofs and how are they used in blockchain?
Zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs) are cryptographic protocols that allow one party (the prover) to prove to another party (the verifier) that a statement is true without revealing any information beyond the validity of the statement itself.

18.How does sharding work in blockchain networks?
Sharding is a technique used in blockchain networks by partitioning the blockchain into smaller, more manageable parts called shards. Each shard processes a subset of transactions independently


19.What are the different types of attacks on blockchain networks and how can they be mitigated?
51% Attack
 An attacker gains control of more than 50% of the network's mining or validation power, allowing them to manipulate transactions
Sybil Attack
  An attacker creates multiple fake identities (Sybil nodes) to voting power in the network.

20.How can blockchain be used for identity verification and management?
Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI)  having control over their own digital identities without relying on central authorities.
Immutable Records immutability ensures that once identity information is recorded, it cannot be altered retroactively without consensus.

21.How do you create a blockchain from scratch using Python?
   Validation, Hashing, Calculating Hash, add block
